# ParticleTracker
Particle tracking using cameras (and depth cameras like the kinect) for the particle levitator

# Milestones/tasks

- [Selection of python library for the kinect](/../../issues/1)

# Cameras
- For general tracking, we'll try kinect v2 as they're cheap in pawn shops right now, and only need 5 mins to mod for PC use.
- If the kinect doesn't work well at short distances, we can buy a trinocular microscope and install a camera https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MRAAR4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005MRAAR4&linkCode=as2&tag=rossmanngroup-20&linkId=8c3b94523f849afcbb9e232f303e4670 This lets us track the evaporation of small droplets to measure diffusion properties, or to track surface waves induced in droplets to measure the surface tension!
