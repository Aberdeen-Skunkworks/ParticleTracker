# ParticleTracker
Particle tracking using cameras (and depth cameras like the kinect) for the particle levitator

# Milestones/tasks

- (Selection of python library for the kinect)[../../issues/1]

# To buy
- A Â£600 trinocular microscope. This lets us track the evaporation of small droplets to measure diffusion properties, or to track surface waves induced in droplets to measure the surface tension!
